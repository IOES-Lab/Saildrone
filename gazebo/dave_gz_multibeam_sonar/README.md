# DAVE Multibeam Sonar Plugin

The DAVE multibeam sonar plugin, adapted for ROS 2 Jazzy and Gazebo Harmonic, uses a ray-based multibeam model that simulates phase, reverberation, and speckle noise through a point scattering approach. It generates realistic intensity-range (A-plot) data while accounting for time and angular ambiguities as well as speckle noise.
