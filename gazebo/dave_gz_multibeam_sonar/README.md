# DAVE Multibeam Sonar Plugin

The DAVE multibeam sonar plugin, adapted for ROS 2 Jazzy and Gazebo Harmonic, uses a ray-based multibeam model that simulates phase, reverberation, and speckle noise through a point scattering approach. It generates realistic intensity-range (A-plot) data while accounting for time and angular ambiguities as well as speckle noise.

> **System Requirement**:
> An **NVIDIA graphics card with CUDA compatibility** is required to use the sonar plugin. This enables GPU-accelerated simulation for real-time performance.
